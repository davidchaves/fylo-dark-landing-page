## Welcome !👋

Thanks for checking out this [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) coding. This is my solution to the [Fylo dark theme landing page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd). I have to build this application using only the preview images and the especifications. To this challenge I created my own design changes and personal improvements to the challenge elements.
